# Postman + JavaScript API Testing Course

This repo tracks my weekly lessons and progress while learning how to write API tests in Postman using JavaScript.

Each folder contains:
- `lesson.md`: The weekly tutorial
- `quiz.md`: A quiz to reinforce learning
- (optional) Postman collections or scripts

Letâ€™s test like champions. ðŸ§ªðŸš€
